Do not use a computer program or electronic dice generator. There is no easy way to be sure they are random enough => need random numbers: https://api.random.org/pricing


1. Decide how many workds you want in your passphrase
    - Recommend a minimum of six words for use with GPG, wireless security and file encryption programs. A seven, eight or nine word passphrase is recommended for high value uses such as whole disk encryption, BitCoin, and the like.
2. Now roll the dice and write down the results on a slip of paper. Write the numbers in groups of five. Make as many of these five-digit groups as you want words in your passphrase. You can roll one die five times or roll five dice once, or any combination in between. If you do roll several dice at a time, read the dice from left to right. 
3. Look up each five digit number in the Diceware list and find the word next to it. For example, 21124 means your next passphrase word would be "clip" (see the excerpt from the English list, above).
4. When you are done, the words that you have found are your new passphrase. Memorize them and then either destroy the scrap of paper or keep it in a really safe place. That's all there is to it!
